Foodie helps you find the best restaurants in your current area. Powered by the Zomato API, it presents up to date location on an interactive map, average customer rating, and other important information about each restaurant.

## Key Features
* Displays the best restaurants in your area as determined by the Zomato API 
* The restaurant cards can be clicked to reveal more information about the restaurants in a modal
* An interactive map of the restaurant's location, the address, average customer rating, type of cuisine, pricing, and phone number are available for each restaurant

## Technologies Used
This app is created using SwiftUI. All of the restaurant data is fetched from the Zomato API. The maps in the restaurant information modal are created using the Apple MapKit.
